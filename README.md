# Java

A repository of my Java projects. Some of which are from my Fundamentals of Programming II course which I'm currently taking at UVic.

This course focuses on further developing techniques and tools for the development and maintenance of software systems and documentation. In doing so it explores basic algorithms, data structures and other core concepts of object-oriented programing. 

Topics of the course also include control and data abstraction, modularization, abstract data types, layers of abstraction, information hiding, separation of concerns, type checking, program design, separate compilation, software libraries, techniques for the development of high-quality software components, program understanding.
